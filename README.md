# mirrorquintic
This code computes the orbits by monodromy action of vanishing cycles in the mirrror quintic Calabi-Yau threefold. 
The globla monodromy in a family of mirror quintic is represented by two matrices M0 and M1. Moreover there are two vectors which represent a Lagrangian 3-sphere and a Lagrangian 3-torus in the mirror quintic.
For prime numbers p, we can compute the orbit of these Lagrangian submanifolds, in the homology with coefficients in Zp (see [1]).
